Cheese or Font
==============

Cheese or Font is a guessing game. You are given a word that is either
the name of a cheese, or the name of a font. You guess, and then it tells
you whether you were correct. You also get to see how other players did
on the same item.

Its official home is http://cheeseorfont.mogrify.org/.

The lists of fonts and cheeses (and a script to load them) are in db/.
